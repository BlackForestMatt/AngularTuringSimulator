Turing Machine Simulator:
-------------------
A Turing Machine consists in simple of a read-write head and an infinite tape on which the head can move.
The machine can have multiple states and must always be in one of these states.
One of these states must be the starting point of the machine and the machine can have multiple accepting endstates.

In one step the read-write-head can move one step left, right or stay in the same position.
In every step:
 - The read-write-head reads a symbol from the tape
 - The Machine changes its state
 - The read-write-head writes a symbol onto the tape
 - The read-write-head moves Left, Right or Neutral
 
How the machine decides what to do is defined by a partially defined function of the form: (z, a) -> z1, b, D with:
 - z  := the current state
 - a  := the current symbol
 - z1 := the new state to change into
 - b  := the new symbol to write
 - D  := the direction to move, with D in {<, -, >}
 
Definition using this simulator:
--------------------------------
To define a Turing Machine for this simulator:
  - A start state, with "start := "
  - A list of accepting states, with "end := {...}"
  - The symbol to use as blank, with "blank := "
  - A list of transition functions, defined as: "(z, a) -> (z1, b, D)" with D in {>, -, <}

States are defined just by using them as a start, end or transition state. They are created by the simulator while loading. States are only defined by their name.
